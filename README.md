# BerryClub Demo

This repository takes an example from the [@fastnear/api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fastnear/api) library, breaking it into a simple, standalone example.

Note that you may login (create session key for a contract) to another smart contract if you wish.

See what you have available in your browser's dev console under the global object `near` created for you.
